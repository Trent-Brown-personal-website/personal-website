                <p class="intro">My name is Trent Brown. I am a former United States Marine who had the privilege of serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I was with 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines 2 Marine Division Task Force Tarawa during the Battle of Nasiriya. We aided in humanitarian efforts for the city of An Numaniyah Iraq were i was able to get to know several local town residents and city leaders while we maintained security on the main supply road. </p>
                <p class="intro">I became a paramedic in 2008 because I had an interest in going to medical school to be an emergency room physician. However due to some combat related injuries and a lifting injury while I was on the ambulance, I was not able to continue. I did have a passion for helping people during the worst days of their lives and was known for being a black cloud on the ambulance. So naturally all of the paramedic and EMT students in the tulsa area all requested to ride along on my ambulance! Since I am a paramedic and every paramedic has the craziest trauma story, mine was a 46 year old female actually cut her own head off purposely with a radial arm table saw. I had a paramedic orientee and an EMT student on my truck that day.</p>
                <p class="intro">In total I have received 7 different Associate's degree's in different sciences. I received my Bachelor's in Cellular and Molecular Biology and my Master's degree in Natural Sciences with my thesis being in Biochemistry.</p>
